# Employees-Burnout-Prediction
### Overview
The project focuses on predicting employee burnout using regression techniques. The goal is to identify employees at risk of burnout by analyzing various factors.

### Dataset Features
1. **Employee ID**: Unique identifier for each employee.
2. **Date of Joining**: When the employee joined the organization.
3. **Gender**: Gender of the employee (Male/Female).
4. **Company Type**: Type of company (Service/Product).
5. **WFH Setup Available**: Availability of work-from-home facility (Yes/No).
6. **Designation**: Employee's designation (0.0 to 5.0, higher is better).
7. **Resource Allocation**: Amount of resources allocated (1.0 to 10.0, higher means more).
8. **Mental Fatigue Score**: Mental fatigue level (0.0 to 10.0, where 10.0 is highest).
9. **Burn Rate**: Target variable indicating burnout rate (0.0 to 1.0).

### Steps to Approach the Project

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Address any missing values.
   - **Convert Categorical Variables**: Use one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
   - **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize features as needed.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - **Understand Distributions**: Analyze distributions of features and target variables.
   - **Correlation Analysis**: Examine relationships between features and the target variable.
   - **Visualizations**: Use visualizations to identify patterns and outliers.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Create New Features**: Develop additional features if relevant (e.g., tenure-based features).
   - **Feature Selection**: Identify and select the most impactful features.

4. **Model Building**:
   - **Split Data**: Divide data into training and testing sets.
   - **Choose Regression Techniques**: Apply various regression methods like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
   - **Train Models**: Train models on the training set and evaluate performance using metrics like RMSE and R-squared.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation to ensure robustness.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.

6. **Model Interpretation and Deployment**:
   - **Interpret Results**: Analyze predictions and feature importance.
   - **Integration**: Integrate the model into HR systems if applicable.

7. **Documentation and Reporting**:
   - **Report Findings**: Document the process, results, and recommendations.
   - **Present Results**: Create a presentation or report for stakeholders.
